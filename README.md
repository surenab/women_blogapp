Welcome to WoBlog, a platform created by a group of passionate women in tech. Our blog is built on Django and Python and is designed to help you share your views on life with the world.

# About Us

<img src="/women_blogapp/photo_readme/-770x482-cc6.jpg" alt="Photo">

We are a diverse group of women from different backgrounds, professions, and expertise areas within the tech industry. Our common goal is to empower, educate, and inspire others by sharing our experiences, expertise, and stories. We believe that diversity is our strength, and our blog is a reflection of the varied perspectives and talents that women bring to the tech world.

The product you see now was created thanks to a charity organization
AGBU Armenia. It was they who gave a chance to learn IT technologies to five ambitious women who, in turn, created this wonderful blog.
