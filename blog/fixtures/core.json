Olympic events were originally only for men, but women’s events were added in 1912. Before the formation of FINA, the Games included some unusual events. In 1900, for instance, when the Games’ swimming events were held on the Seine River in France, a 200-metre obstacle race involved climbing over a pole and a line of boats and swimming under them. Such oddities disappeared after FINA took charge. Under FINA regulations, for both Olympic and other world competition, race lengths came increasingly to be measured in metres, and in 1969 world records for yard-measured races were abolished. The kinds of strokes allowed were reduced to freestyle (crawl), backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly. All four strokes were used in individual medley races. Many nations have at one time or another dominated Olympic and world competition, including Hungary, Denmark, Australia, Germany, France, Great Britain, Canada, Japan, and the United States.", "image": "Media/Man-swimming.png", "view_count": 0}}, {"model": "core.blog", "pk": 12, "fields": {"blog_category": "4", "title": "Golden Retriever", "created_on": "2023-08-11", "user": 3, "description": "The Golden Retriever is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog.\r\n\r\nThe breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.", "image": "Media/golden_retriver.jpg", "view_count": 0}}, {"model": "core.blog", "pk": 13, "fields": {"blog_category": "4", "title": "Poodle", "created_on": "2023-08-10", "user": 3, "description": "The poodle, one of a number of elegant French dog breeds, is often seen as high maintenance. (That curly hair isn’t going to style itself, after all.) But don’t be fooled into thinking that makes them any less clever. The breed gets high marks for its emotional and cognitive intelligence. In fact, Coren ranks the poodle second among the smartest dog breeds, right after the border collie.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, sure, the dogs can look a bit posh, but they’ve also been employed during wartime to deliver supplies to soldiers on the battlefield. The job required obedience, steadfast focus, and clear-headed decision-making, and quick-learning poodles became the obvious choice. Veterinarian Wendy Hauser, DVM, says poodles are readily trainable and enjoy activities that allow them to be challenged, such as hunting, tracking, agility sports, and obedience work. On top of all that, the breed has a jovial sense of humor and a tendency to perform tricks and deliberately act cute. Not that humans need more reasons to love ’em. No matter the size—from teacup to standard—poodles are oodles of fun and majorly cute.", "image": "Media/myking.jpg", "view_count": 0}}, {"model": "core.blog", "pk": 14, "fields": {"blog_category": "5", "title": "Cake Prague", "created_on": "2023-08-10", "user": 3, "description": "As a self-proclaimed chocolate lover, Cake Prague is near and dear to my heart.

It’s ultra-sweet, soaked in sweetened condensed milk, and worthy of bring in the window of the fanciest bakery.\r\n\r\nAlthough the recipe card looks quite long, Cake Prague doesn’t require super technical baking skills to make.

With few direct roads between them, and with passage from one point to another traditionally difficult, Italy’s towns and cities have a history of self-sufficiency, independence, and mutual mistrust. Visitors today remark on how unlike one town is from the next, on the marked differences in cuisine and dialect, and on the many subtle divergences that make Italy seem less a single nation than a collection of culturally related points in an uncommonly pleasing setting.", "image": "Media/italy.webp", "view_count": 0}}]
